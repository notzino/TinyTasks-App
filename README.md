# TinyTasks-App
TinyTask is a group app project for our ISD module. It is designed to help children with autism manage their schedules. I led the protype & design using Adobe XD, focusing on a user-friendly interface and calming colors tailored for autistic users. Our process involved creating personas and testing with demo users.
